# PI_SybilAttackDetecting
A mechanism for detecting a Sybil Attack in a ad-hoc network with IoT applications.
In order to achieve a IoT network we're using arduino and LoRa Heltec. The implementation is performed with c++ classes which represent a node and a sybil node (this one exchange many identities in the network).
